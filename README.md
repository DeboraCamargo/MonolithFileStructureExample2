Separate by Layers - Layer in projects

Models could be a folder in contracts as well
Our view(VueJS) project would inside the folder (but not the vs solution)

Each layer(Business, contract...) will be a project
Domains will be contained across all layers

Pros
It won't grow too much or get messy

Cons
Layer project will grow
To change one feature we may have to alter every layer
